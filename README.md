# Super-Store-KPI-Dashboard

Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Tableau


### **Stituation**

As an aspiring data analyst, I decided to work on a Tableau project, that would allow me to gain hands on experience with turning data into an interactive and informative dashboard 

### **Task**
I tasked myself with creating an interactive Tableau dashboard, that will show the key KPIs of Superstore's sales performanc in the US with a breakdown on month, coustomer segment product sales and States. My goal was to make an interactive data visualisation that various stakeholders could use to evaluate their business performance, and which I could outline recommendations based on. 


### **Action**
- I started out by identifying the challengse the dashboard is meant to solve, then I outline the needs/requirements of the dasbhoard based on it for the various stakeholders, then I plan the dashboard and finally I began the creation of the dashboard.

Some of the questions I would like the dashboard to anwser are the following:

- What are the marketable and profitable products for each segment, region, state, and city?
- What are the not-marketable and not-profitable products for each segment, region, state, and city?
- What products have high discount and return rates for each segment, region, state, and city?

I began by create seperate sheets for each of the qustions and started building out the dashboard by creating calculated fields,developing the different graphs and added filters for interaction. I finalised the dashboard with formatting it with my prefered colour scheme. 
  

### **Result**

The project was completed within the timeframe I had set for myself and resulted in an interactive dashboard from which I could draw the following conclusions 

- Home office is the customer segment with the lowest sales volume
- All categories seems to experience a peak in sales in November and/or December, but besides that experience flucuration in sales volume
- Minnesota is the State with the highest profit ratio and Ohio is the one with the lowest

Please feel free to interact with the dashboard to make your own conclusions

**Recommendations**   
1. Identify what is leading the low sales volume for home office - SuperStore could potentially look into running a work from home marketing to drive up sales
2. Profit Ratio on a regional breakdown is the lowest in the Central region, which is also the region with the highest average discount - SuperStore should look into its pricing strategy in the region and potienally reduce discounts, to become profitable 
3. The Furniture segment seems to experience a trend of decreasing profit ratio - I would advise SuperStore to look into their funiture production or manufactuers to identify the reason behind this trend
